# Challenge #1: Dockerize an existing application

## Description

Your goal is to dockerize one of your existing ASP.NET Core or Java applications.

**.NET Core**  
This example assumes you already have an ASP.NET Core app on your machine. If you don't have one already, you can create a [simple application](https://www.asp.net/get-started) or clone the [ASP.NET Docker Sample](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker-samples/tree/master/aspnetapp). To get the most out of these hands-on labs, we recommend you use one of your existing applications. 

**Java**
This example assumes you already have a Java app on your machine.
